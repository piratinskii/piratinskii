####  []()<img src="python.png" height="15" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="Written in Python"></img> [Edu Automator (Automated student registration system)](https://github.com/piratinskii/EduAutomator/) - in this project I had to automatizate some proccess in our company. All our students were entered into a registry located in Google Sheets. My task was to ensure that once all the student's data was filled out, my system would register that student on our Moodle portal. Then, it would check if the course they enrolled in already existed in Moodle. If it did, the system would enroll the user in that course and send a welcome email with login credentials. Otherwise, it would send an email to the administrator indicating the need to add the course to the portal. Written in Python, using API of Google and Moodle.

#### []()<img src="python.png" height="15" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="Written in Python"></img> <img src="js.png" height="15" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="Written in JavaScript"></img> [Open Source Ticket System Backend](https://github.com/piratinskii/Ticket-System-Backend) and [Frontend](https://github.com/piratinskii/Ticket-System-Frontend) - My pet full-stack RESTful project is a simple ticket system with a basic web UI. The project is currently unfinished - it's just the beginning of the journey. Written using FastAPI (Python) and VueJS (JavaScript).

<div align=right><h5><a href=""></a>ðŸ“† 2024</h5></div>
#### <img src="python.png" height="15" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="Written in Python"></img> [Py.Rex](https://github.com/piratinskii/Py.Rex) - This project is a simple console implementation of the Google Chrome Dinosaur game. It is intentionally written with minimal use of external frameworks and libraries, keeping it as straightforward as possible. All graphics are directly displayed in the console as characters and are redrawn with each frame change. All objects in the game are also character-based, without using complex graphics. The difficulty level gradually increases after the game starts, with cacti appearing more frequently. The game's environment (the starry sky and the moon) is randomly generated, so the sky will be different each time you launch the game. You can run this program even on a server with minimal available resources (though I don't recommend doing that; it's just a joke).
